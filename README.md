# K Container Shipment Order Management

This project is one reference implementation of the CQRS and event sourcing patterns as part of the [Event Driven Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda) reference architecture. From a use case point of view, it implements one of the [K Container shipment process](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc) microservices. This repository aims to support the order management for the manufactorer to the shipment company order. The business process is defined [here](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/blob/master/analysis/readme.md).

## User stories
The business requirements and Epics are defined in [this note](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc#orders-microservice-place-shipment-order---user-story)

The following 
- [ ] As a manufacturer manager I want to enter shipment order information like product reference, quantity, shipment address and expected delivery date so the shipping company can give me back an order confirmation and confirmed delivery date range, the container and ship name
> As the microservice will not have a dedicated UI, we are using the demonstration UI to define forms to gather the data. So this user story is implemented in the kc-ui project, and in this microservice we need to offer the create and update operations and get by order ID
- [ ] As a manufacturer manager I want to read the status of an order given its order id. 
> The order id is generated by the create operation, and is ummutable.
- [ ] As a shipment company manager I want to update the status of an order, and add container and ship information once I know them, modify pickup date and expected delivery date.
> Same as above the UI is in kc-ui, so here is a model and the update operation.

## Model

The current Order is defined from the user interface point of view and looks like:

```
```

## Event Sourcing

The pattern is well described in [this article on microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/event-sourcing.html). To summarize evnt sourcing persists the states of business entity as a sequence of state changing events. Applications reconstruct the business entity current state by replaying the events. It is a very important pattern for EDA and microservices to microservices data synchronization needs. A view of entity states is build from the events or facts. It adds the value to provide a reliable audit log.

See also this nice [event sourcing article](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) from Martin Fowler, where he is also using ship movement example. Our implementation differs here and we are using Kafka topic as event store and use the Order business entity.

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern

This pattern helps to address how to implement a query to retrieve data from different microservices?

The CQRS pattern was introduced by [Greg Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHGkaShoyNs), https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html
