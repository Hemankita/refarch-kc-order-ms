# refarch-kc-order-ms

KContainer shipment microservices for order management to illustrate CQRS and Event Sourcing. This project is part of the [Event Driven Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-eda) reference architecture [solution implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc) and aims to support the process as defined [here](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/blob/master/analysis/readme.md).

## User stories to support

- [ ] As a shop manager I want to enter order information like product reference, quantity, shipment address and expected delivery date so the manufacturer can give me back an order confirmation and confirmed delivery date range.
- [ ] As a manufacturer manager I want to list the newly created orders, and confirm an order and set delivery date for that order once I received the confirmation from the shipment supplier, I will update the product cost.
- [ ] As a shipment company manager I want to see the order I can help to ship the goods to target address.
